# What is this?
This is a Win64-based injector for the Unity3D engine.

# What can I do with this?
You can use this injector to dump out any C# module loaded into Unity. You can then decompile, modify, and load these modules. The injector will basically replace any 
references made to the original assemblies with your own. This allows you to basically create your own Assembly-CSharp and Assembly-CSharp-firstpass modules.
